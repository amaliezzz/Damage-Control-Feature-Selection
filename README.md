### Mortality Prognostic Factors in Patients Undergoing Damage Control Surgery in Intensive Care Units

---

The prediction of **mortality prognostic factors** in patients undergoing **damage control surgery with abdominal packing** represents a significant clinical challenge. Using a limited dataset, a detailed exploratory analysis and key variable selection were performed through **machine learning models**. Five primary outcome predictors were identified. The final model, evaluated using cross-validation (**Leave-One-Out**) and data augmentation techniques (**SMOTE**), achieved an impressive **F1-score of 0.963**. Interpretability with **SHAP** confirmed the clinical relevance of the variables, supporting the model’s reliability in detecting critical prognostic indicators.
