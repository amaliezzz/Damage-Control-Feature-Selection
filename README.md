The prediction of mortality prognostic factors in patients undergoing damage control surgery with abdominal packing represents a significant clinical challenge. Using a limited dataset, a detailed exploratory analysis and key variable selection were performed through machine learning models. Five primary predictors of outcome predictors were identified. The final model, evaluated using cross-validation (Leave-One-Out) and data augmentation techniques (SMOTE), achieved an F1-score of 0.963. Interpretability with SHAP confirmed the clinical relevance of the variables, supporting the modelâ€™s reliability in detecting critical prognostic indicators.
